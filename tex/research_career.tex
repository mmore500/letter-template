Next year, I will enter a computer science PhD program.
I have been invited to work with Dr.
Charles Ofria at Michigan State University in association with the BEACON NSF Center on a recruiting fellowship.
My ultimate career aspiration is to develop biologically-inspired approaches to artificial intelligence in industry.
The {\companyposition} is an ideal match with my own career interests.
I would find the position rewarding and enjoyable in an immediate sense and I would also see it as a key component of my long-term career trajectory.
