Throughout my collegiate career, I have also pursued a number of opportunities for leadership in service and outreach.
In particular, I have focused on building community centered around music and STEM and building inroads to those communities for Tacoma-area students.
Among other activities, I worked as a section coach with the Puget Sound Youth Wind Ensemble, served as a tutor, homework club leader, and classroom assistant at several Tacoma High Schools, and have co-founded and continue to coordinate a departmental mentoring program in computer science.
Through these service activities, I have developed the initiative and skills to take action to build community and worked to be more cognizant of systemic barriers to inclusivity.
I will bring this passion for community and inclusiveness to any academic or professional environment that I participate in.
