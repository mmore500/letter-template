I am writing to apply for an internship position at {\companylong}.
Although I am not yet a PhD candidate, I believe that I would be a good fit at {\companyshort}.
I am a technically proficient, driven, and team-oriented student passionate about biologically-inspired algorithm design.
My academic research interests lie at the intersection of biology and computing, particularly in relation to evolution.
Last summer, I worked with the Swarm Lab at NJIT to model the foraging dynamics of ants on uneven terrain.
This year, I wrote an undergraduate thesis on theoretical aspects of evolvability and conducted computational experiments to investigate the relationship between plasticity and evolvability in genetic regulatory network models.
I received an honorable mention from the NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship Program for a project proposal entitled ``Promoting Irregular Refinement Potential in Evolving Artificial Neural Networks.''
