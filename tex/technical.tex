I am currently wrapping up my undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science at the University of Puget Sound.
During my time at the University, I have I have enjoyed many opportunities to tackle hard technical problems in small teams.
In CSCI 240 Software Engineering, I worked with two other students to develop a web application on the MEAN stack using MEAN.JS.
We developed an idea journal service that collects and displays metadata to help users understand where, when, and how they are most creative.
Through this semester-long project, I demonstrated an ability to quickly develop a working knowledge of new frameworks and programming languages.
Since 2015, I have participated in the annual Mathematical Competition in Modeling.
In this four-day event, I collaborated in a team of three students to develop a mathematical model in response to a prompt, draft a report describing the model, and outline recommendations to policy makers based on analysis of the model.
Last year, we developed a model of satellite fragmentation events to investigate the feasibility of quick-response efforts to neutralize debris, receiving an honorable mention designation in the competition.
Competing in the MCM, I have honed my ability for effective project planning and management under time pressure.
